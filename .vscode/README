/*** SERVE OR BUILD STRYPE EDITOR ***/

In order to serve or build Strype editor (python or microbit) follow the following procedure:

1) make sure no service (serve/build) is running, and stop it if so
2) Launch the task for either serving or building the app for microbit/python. (Go to "Terminal > Run task..." and choose one of:
    - Serve Strype micro:bit
    - Serve Strype python
    - Build Strype micro:bit
    - Build Strype python

The tasks clear the npm cache and the cache-loader so that the code is compiled totally again.

During development, you can use the npm or serve commands if you prefer -- but be aware that caching will prevent conditional rendering (in that case you'd need to through each file containing the /*IFTRUE_xxx directive and make a change to regenerate those files with the right condition applied)
